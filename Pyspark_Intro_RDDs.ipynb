    "The volume of unstructured text in existence is growing dramatically, and Spark is an excellent tool for analyzing this type of data.  In this homework, we will write code that calculates the most common words in the [Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page).\n",

    "    - With a larger dataset, the distribution of words across partitions becomes more uniform, reducing the potential for skewed data distribution. This could benefit methods like reduceByKey() and groupByKey() by allowing for more balanced workload distribution and efficient parallel processing. It can be seen that as the dataset size increases, the time of method 2a increases uniformly. \n",

    "    - It is expected that the reduceByKey() method should take the least amount of time as the dataset grows larger. This is because reduceByKey() performs local aggregation within each partition before shuffling the results. This can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network. \n",
